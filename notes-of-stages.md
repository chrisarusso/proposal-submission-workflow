 Proposal Steps - get in AI tooling
Organizing all relevant documentation. Can include:
RFP / any documentation included by prospect
Any additional research Savas team members has done alongside
Recorded call transcripts 
Put all into NotebookLM to organize

In preparing the proposal, we feel the top things to ensure are included.
A tight review of requirements from the RFP
Things that we identify from the documentation that must be in there, that’s essentially parroting back what they want to hear
What we feel are key differentiators/our takes on what are most important to mention – needs to be done by SME/Chris for now

Estimates/Budget Provided
Team’s done some sort of estimation process
Budget notes are clear from RFP
Chris approves final budget that shows

Prepping before Chris reviews:
Go through the full checklist – Zakk pushes a button and AI does:
Looks at all of NotebookLM and checks to verify everything we wrote down AND their document says needs to be in there is in there
That checks against the checklist we’ve built to ensure these things are in there, and spelling and grammar, gives him the opportunity to review make updates, and when it all passes for final review

All proposals either include: 
A recorded video (we should look into better analytics than Loom)
Should take advantage of Descript making things better, getting rid of filler words
Presentation/demo
